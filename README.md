Just download the excercise that you want to run and open the instructions that are part of the archive.



## Semantic Neurofeedback

In this hands-on session we will use the TBV Data Simulator tool to generate artificial fMRI data. You learn how to simulate different activity patterns across experimental conditions and inject different noise types in your simulated data.<br>
We will use the simulated data to run a basic Semantic Neurofeedback experiment, exploiting TBV network interface.

You can download the example data and tools that we will use in this session at this link: [rtRSAData Link](https://sharecenter.brainvoyager.com/s/ptYe4wdTbSm2XRb)
