# Turbo-BrainVoyager Workshop - rtFIN 2024


Welcome to the TBV workshop page!<br> Here you will find information about the workshop and useful links to participate to our hands-on sessions.

For Windows users, we provide the TBV Educational version at this link: [TBVEDU link](https://download.brainvoyager.com/tbv/setup_tbvedu-v4.4.8_win-x64.exe).
If you don't have a Windows laptop, please team up with another participant of the workshop or ask one of our colleague if there is still a laptop available.

Please install Turbo-BrainVoyager EDU to participate actively to the hands-on session!

There will be two hands-on session which you can choose: Basic hands-on or Semantic Neurofeedback.
For beginners we recommend to join the Basic hands-on session and for advanced users or people that are interested in the specific topic the Semantic Neurofeedback workshop.

**Please don't hesitate to ask questions about the excercise or general to one of our colleagues that are around during the excersice.**

## Basic hands-on 

In this hands-on session, you can chooce from three different excercises: [SampleData link](https://brainvoyager.com/tbv/sampledata/index.html).

Just download the excercise that you want to run and open the instructions that are part of the archive.

## Semantic Neurofeedback

In this hands-on session, we will use the TBV Data Simulator tool to generate artificial fMRI data. You will learn to simulate different activity patterns across experimental conditions and inject different types of noise in your artificial data.<br>
We will use the simulated data to run a basic Semantic Neurofeedback experiment, exploiting TBV network interface.

You can download the example data and tools that we will use in this session at this link: [rtRSAData Link](https://sharecenter.brainvoyager.com/s/ptYe4wdTbSm2XRb)
